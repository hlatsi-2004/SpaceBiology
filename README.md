SpaceBiology 🧬🚀

Enabling a new era of human space exploration by unlocking the knowledge from decades of NASA's biological research.

As humans prepare to revisit the Moon and journey to Mars, understanding the effects of spaceflight on biology is more critical than ever. NASA has been performing biology experiments in space for decades, generating a tremendous amount of information. This project aims to centralize, organize, and provide tools to analyze this data, making it accessible for the next generation of explorers and scientists.

 🎯 Project Goals

Data Aggregation:Collect and standardize data from various NASA space biology missions and experiments.
Analysis Tools:Provide open-source scripts and software for analyzing space biology data (e.g., gene expression, plant growth, microbial behavior).
Knowledge Base:** Create a curated repository of findings, publications, and metadata linked to the experimental data.
Collaboration:** Foster a community where researchers can share insights and build upon existing work.
